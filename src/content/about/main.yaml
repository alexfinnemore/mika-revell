bio: >-
  Mika Revell (b. 1985, Sydney, Australia) is a Chinese-American multimedia
  artist. Her work delves into the complex relationship between symbols of power
  and commodity, contrasting the ominous and alluring. Using pink pigments and
  polished finishes, she investigates the processes of manufacturing and labor.
  Her sculptures interrogate the global supply chain of resources and human
  life. Revell explores how weapons and commodification shape our desires. Her
  latest series addresses themes of power, war, and wealth both beautiful and
  unsettling. She received her MFA in Sculpture from Central Saint Martin's,
  London, and international residencies in Riyadh, Tokyo, and Los Angeles.


  Her recent solo show, SOFTCORE WAR, explores the natural world wrapped in
  fetishized commodity. Territorial, ideological, and environmental conflicts
  surround us, yet we are desensitized, entertained, and addicted. Softcore War
  examines this seemingly contradictory, but accepted, reality.


  Using her signature pink as a panacea, Revell subverts symbols of violence
  with pacifism and levity. She employs satire and absurdity to expose how we
  accept our dystopian present. An inflatable bomb mocks the grotesque
  celebration of destruction, while post-human, sculptures depicting rapid
  evolution hint at the effects of industry on the body.


  Combining organic and manufactured materials, with symbols of violence and
  enjoyment, Revell exposes the ways we package and accept a brutal and
  competitive world.
