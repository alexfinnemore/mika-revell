  This series of paintings explores the use of imagery, images of destruction,
  and the mediation of global and environmental disasters through the media.
  Each painting presents a manmade disaster depicted in international news
  outlets and social media. Revell uses oil-based paint, in hyper-saturated
  pinks and purples, depicting a rose-colored lens through which these horrific
  events are distorted.

  From Hiroshima to the oil fields of Kuwait, each painting is a document of
  man's folly and Nature's fury. This series presents the viewer with a stark
  reality of the arrogance in the Anthropocene.
