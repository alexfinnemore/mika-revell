  Revell proposes an important paradox — a war of love. To shift the tides of
  manipulative media, self-surveillance, and western-conformist Olympics; the
  micro-activism of guerrilla propaganda must become a tidal wave of tolerance —
  an empathetic revolution.

  This series highlights the hypernormalized state of unrest that has become a
  condition of contemporary life. Generations born into a global climate
  characterized by conflict, extraction, and extinction have been denied the
  simple romantic ideas — potential, hope, and distant futures.

  This series responds to this shift within post-modernity, from a rejection of
  art historical traditions to an all-out assault on colonialism, and
  white-narratives of Otherness. Jacques Lacan describes "The Big Other" as the
  pervasive myth that maintains the status quo, an opiate of the masses, a
  divider of power, and a destroyer of intellectual agency. Revell's work pushes
  the viewer to question their beliefs about the hidden Big Other in their
  ideology.
