slug: softcore-war
subtitle: BRUTAL. Gallery - Cape Town
year: 2023
description: >
  A large, inert rock sits beneath a giant, pink balloon. It sees itself
  reflected in the polished surface, staring back at a rose-colored world. We
  see the natural world wrapped in fetishized commodities.


  Territorial, ideological, and environmental conflicts surround us, yet we are
  desensitized, entertained, and addicted. Softcore War examines this seemingly
  contradictory, but accepted reality.


  Using her signature pink as a panacea, Revell subverts symbols of violence
  with pacifism and levity. Mika employs satire and absurdity to expose how we
  accept our dystopian present. An inflatable bomb mocks the grotesque
  celebration of destruction, while sculptures depicting rapid evolution hint at
  the effects of industry on the human body.


  Combining organic and manufactured materials, with symbols of violence and
  enjoyment, Revell exposes the ways we package and accept a brutal and
  competitive world.


  What alternative worlds could we create? What is holding us back?
