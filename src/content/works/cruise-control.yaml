description: >-
  Are we asleep at the wheel? Cruise Control presents a world where bodily
  autonomy, humanity, and technology are in constant flux. We ask ourselves, Who
  is in control?



  Are we just drifting inside the machine? Did we concede to automation over
  autonomy, compliance over choice, convenience over freedom? How can we escape
  these binary contradictions and traverse an alternate way?



  The exhibition included an audio-visual work that forced the viewer into a
  rapid, wall-sized, scrolling film of social media content and rapid audio.
  Creating a disorienting and unpleasant environment within the gallery.
