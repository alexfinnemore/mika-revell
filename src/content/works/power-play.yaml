  Revell's latest series of artwork delves into the intriguing relationship
  between symbols of power and commodified objects of desire, exploring the
  tensions that arise between them. Revell's artwork deftly contrasts the
  ominous and the alluring, weaponizing pink polished chrome, acrylic finger
  nails, and latex finishes to create a surreal and dark hyperreality.

  Works in this series included a guerilla poster campaign during the 2022
  Venice Biennale, featuring bright, metallic, sea mines, cresting above the
  water line of the Grand Canal. These advertisements were plastered over
  existing marketing in and around the city during the exhibition. These bombs
  were later realized and fabricated during Revell's residence at Jax District,
  Diriyah in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2023.

  At the heart of her artwork is the exploration of how power and
  commodification shape our desires and how these forbidden fascinations are
  often blurred. Her artistry fuses seemingly oppositional concepts, creating
  fetishized objects such as handbags, and sex toys, with a hint of
  post-feminist, military-industrial satire.

  Revell plays with the complexities of power and control, examining how they
  can be created, sold, kept, and destroyed. Her art probes the transformations
  and transfers of power, transcending mere physicality and possession.
