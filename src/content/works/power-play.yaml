  Revell's latest series of artwork delves into the intriguing relationship
  between symbols of power and commodified objects of desire, exploring the
  tensions that arise between them. Revell's artwork deftly contrasts the
  ominous and the alluring, weaponizing pink polished chrome, acrylic finger
  nails, and latex finishes to create a surreal and dark hyperreality.


  Works in this series included a guerilla poster campaign during the 2022
  Venice Biennale, featuring bright, metallic, sea mines, cresting above the
  water line of the Grand Canal. These advertisements were plastered over
  existing marketing in and around the city during the exhibition. These bombs
  were later realized and fabricated during Revell's residence at Jax District,
  Diriyah in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 2023.


  At the heart of her artwork is the exploration of how power and
  commodification shape our desires and how these forbidden fascinations are
  often blurred. Her artistry fuses seemingly oppositional concepts, creating
  fetishized objects such as handbags, and sex toys, with a hint of
  post-feminist, military-industrial satire.


  Revell plays with the complexities of power and control, examining how they
  can be created, sold, kept, and destroyed. Her art probes the transformations
  and transfers of power, transcending mere physicality and possession,
  questioning who possesses control and holds influence.


  Drawing from historical references such as medieval armor and weaponry, Revell
  explores how these structures have evolved. Once a means of protection, the
  cellular structures of snakes, fish, and animals, are now a symbol of future
  warfare. Her artwork examines how these repetitive shapes and structures can
  function democratically, forming a single barrier, yet taking on a sinister
  role in the future of tech and defense.


  At the intersection of beautiful objects, fetishized brands, commodities, and
  wealth, Revell probes our fascination with power, war, and weapons. Her art
  explores the futility of life, shame, fear, and the role of art in disarming
  man. The artist's exploration of subverting images of weapons and war in her
  unnatural disaster series highlights the intersection of ideas and the potency
  of her artistic expression.
